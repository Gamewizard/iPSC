# iPSC
An attempt to document and preserve the Intel iPSC platforms.

# Why This Project

It was here recently brought to my attention how little documentation from the Intel iPSC has been preserved.
This project is an attempt to fix that.
If you have any thing related to the platform don't be affraid to open an issue on the repository.

# Some New Information

So I here recetly checked Computer History Museum's archive search they currently do have some of the documentation for select models but not very much. 
I have reached out to them to see what all they have, and if they have any of it scanned yet.
